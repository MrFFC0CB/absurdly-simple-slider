# Absurdly Simple Slider

A really simple Javascript slider.

---

## üß† Why?

It started as a super basic image slider I built for a work project that needed something lightweight and simple. Over time, similar needs kept popping up in other projects‚Äîsometimes with extra requirements. So I kept tweaking the original code, adding features as needed, and eventually, it evolved into its own thing: a general-purpose, absurdly simple slider.

## üöÄ Features

- No dependencies
- Just two files
- Navigation via arrows, bullets, or both.
- Supports keyboard navigation (slider must be focused)
- Supports captions
- Minimal API, no drama
- Lightweight (~10KB minified files)

---

## üì¶ Installation

Download the files at `dist` folder and place them wherever you want in your project.

Include the CSS file inside your `<head>` element.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="absurdly-simple-slider/as-slider.min.css">
```

Add the JS file at the end of your `<body>` element.
```html
<script src="absurdly-simple-slider/as-slider.min.js"></script>
```

---

## üß± Basic Usage

```html
<div class="slider">
	<img src="images/slide-1.jpg" alt="">
	<img src="images/slide-2.jpg" alt="">
	<img src="images/slide-3.jpg" alt="">
</div>

<script>
	const slider = new AsSlider(".slider").init();
</script>
```
Alternatively, you can create the instance first and call `init()` later in your code:
```js
// create slider instance
const slider = new AsSlider(".slider");

/*
 rest of your code
*/

// initialize slider
slider.init();
```
